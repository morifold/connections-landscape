# Planetary Brain

Planetary Brain (connections-landscape) visualizes relationships encoded by a directed graph as the geography of a virtual world. Think of it as a mind palace emergent from graph data.

## Usage

```js
import { createVis } from 'connections-landscape';

// initializes visualization with specified config, data and DOM parent
createVis(graphConfig, graphData, elem);
```
